                        <br>It will make both of us more comfortable.
                        <br>People used to call me wan because it more easier to call include my family. I am 21 years old

                        <br>But i am not the pampered one in the family. 
                        <br>The pampered one in the family is my fourth sister. Although, i not feel any jealousy because i used to it. 
                        <br>I was a caring person but i also the most careless person in the family. 
                        <br>I am not like others siblings, i was the patient one like my mother. I am not hot temper like my brother.

                        <br> when I was in this school, I was not as active as when I was in primary school because 
                        <br> I had a lot of competitors.
                        <br> I almost give up in study, but i realized that one day also have to raised my own family
                        <br> so i had to study well in order to get better result in my life.

                    <p>I got my first experience when i work at Jakel's.
                        <br> I work at Jakel for few month because i dont want to ask money from my parent, 
                        <br> so i go to work in order to have my own pocket money and i also give my parent from my own money. 
                        <br> It might be tired at Jakel because i had to be helper and not business class so it make me little tired. 
                        <br> But i also happy work Jakel because i got so many new friends even the manager and the boss of the Jakel 
                        <br> a little annoying.

                    <p>I work at Baker's Cottage on semester break. 
                        <br> I work at there for 2 month only so i got my own pocket money before i continue my semester 3. 
                        <br> Work at Baker's Cottage is extremely tired either physically or mentallity because there are too many 
                        <br> two faced worker there.
                        <br> Salary on Baker's Cottage also a bit less than i work at Jakel because the headquarter doesnt allowed us 
                        <br> part-time worker to take overtime so i dont get chance to increase my pocket money.
